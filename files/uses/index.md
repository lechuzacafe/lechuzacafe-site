My OS of choice for a few years now has been anything Arch Linux-based, but my current distro is Artix Linux. I love how it's free of systemd and it just works in a very solid manner. It has an easier installer, too!

My desktop runs on a Ryzen 7 5700X, an RX 6800 XT, and 32 gigabytes of RAM. It's fantastic for 1440p video games... when I find the time to play them. My laptop of choice is a *Thinkpad T480*, as I wanted something very serviceable and lightweight to take on the go.
