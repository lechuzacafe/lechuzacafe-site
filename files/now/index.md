# what am I doing now?

As of 21 August, 2024.... working on this website. 

University for me starts in a week, so I've been very busy on the paperwork end.

I've been trying to get back into language learning! I lost motivation for a good few months due to personal life events, but I think I'm a bit more confident now.

I've also have been trying to prepare for my next semester's calculus course as... I'm pretty bad in my mathematics courses, and I really do not want to fail it. It's honestly a lot of pressure, but I'm sure I'll make it if I work hard enough.
