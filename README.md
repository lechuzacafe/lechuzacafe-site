This website is hosted on a LEMP stack running on a RoyaleHosting VPS, and built using 11ty. My primary focus is running public instances on it.

Currently running instances:

**Public:** 

*Searx*

*Privatebin*





**Private (invite only):**



*Vaultwarden*

*Email (using Snappymail)*







**To-do (services I'd like to add):**

*cgit (needs proper configuration*

*Invidious (Youtube proxy)*

*Redlib (Reddit proxy)*

*Wireguard (currently running, but needs a better front-end)*


**Deprecated (services I no longer run):**

*Forgejo (made redundant by cgit)*
*Wacintaki Oekaki (currently private)*
*MediaWiki (was for testing purposes)*
